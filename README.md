Terminal applications
========================

Building OS-agnostic and customizable applications within terminal.

## Merits

1. When we run any python script in Python it also shows the shell name and previous responses. The approach shown here
   cleans the terminal and presents empty window for focused viewing and interaction.
2. Takes custom inputs and updates the results in real-time
3. Customize the application with colors and many styling options
4. Take control of terminal so that we can style, update, and refresh
